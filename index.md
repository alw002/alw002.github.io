## **About** **Me**
As of **Fall** **2022**, I am in the last year of my undergraduate education majoring in Computer Engineering at UCSD. As of recently, I would say my favorite programming language is Python because of its wide applications in AI/ML.

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

## **Fall** **2022** **Classes**
The classes that I am enrolled in for the **Fall 2022** quarter are as follows:
- *CSE110*
- *CSE158*
- *CSE190*
- *ENG100D*

All four of these classes have some sort of solo/group project that will happen down the line.
> Surely I will be able handle all of them together and not drop either *CSE190* or *ENG100D* down the line.
